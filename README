# cf_ai_financial_advisor

A serverless AI trading assistant built on Cloudflare Workers. This application leverages Workers AI for inference and Workers KV for persistent session memory, fulfilling the requirements for a full-stack AI application on the Edge.

## Architecture

* Runtime: Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript)
* Inference: `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` (Workers AI)
* State Management: Cloudflare Workers KV (Stores chat history per session)
* Frontend: Server-side rendered HTML/JS with Markdown support (served directly by the Worker)

## Cloudflare Account

## Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd cf_ai_financial_advisor
Install dependencies:

Bash
npm install
Authenticate with Cloudflare:

Bash
npx wrangler login
Configure KV Namespace:
The application requires a KV namespace to store chat history.

Bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create "CHAT_HISTORY"
Copy the id output from the terminal and update the wrangler.json file:

JSON
"kv_namespaces": [
  {
    "binding": "CHAT_HISTORY",
    "id": "<YOUR_KV_ID_HERE>"
  }
]

## Development
To run the worker locally while using remote AI bindings (accessing Cloudflare GPUs):

Bash
npx wrangler dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:8787.

Note: The session ID is generated client-side on page load. Refreshing the page clears the local session context.

## Deployment
To deploy the application to the Cloudflare global network:

Bash
npx wrangler deploy
Usage Example
Open the deployed URL.

Ask a concept: "Explain High Frequency Trading."

Test Memory: Ask "Write a Python script for it." (The model will recall "it" refers to HFT).

## View Code: The response will render formatted code blocks using Markdown.
